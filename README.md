# A Bird's Land

Prototype of game using PhaserJS

## Installation

``` bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

The development server is available on port `1234`

## Troubleshooting

<details>
  <summary>First parcel compilation hangs up</summary>
  <p>
    The first `npm run dev` can result in a hang up when Parcel tries to compile PhaserJS's code. Re-running `npm run dev` has proven useful in some cases (in my case I ran it 5 times until it was finally done compiling all of Phaser's files).
